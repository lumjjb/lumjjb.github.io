title: Blog Reboot!
---

It's been a while since I wrote an article for my blog. I've decided recently to start writing articles again! Over the years, my technical interest has shifted slightly from penetration testing to software engineering and computer science. 

## What I've been up to

During the hiatus from security blogging (about 6 years), I got my degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU, 4 years) and have been working at IBM Research (2 years). 

CMU was an eye-opener for me. It gave me a whole different perspective of computation, and programming. Most of the classes that I took were computer science classes. Although most of the content was not security-related, I brought along the security mindset with me throughout the years. I also got to be a part of PPP, which was a great experience filled with a lot of talented and friendly people! My focus at CMU was mainly systems classes, I took way more than I needed to.
And I also dabbled in AI and machine learning (enough to get me a minor too :)). In all though, CMU was a very fun experience and I got the chance to meet a ton of interesting people and forged many lasting friendships.

At IBM Research, my work still revolves around security, with respect to container technologies (i.e. docker, kubernetes, etc.). However, my main focus is no longer primarily trying to find vulnerabilities in applications, but to identifying gaps in the technology and ecosystem, and architecting solutions to promote better security. Some of the projects that I've been involved with respect to this are container image signing, encryption, update services.

I've also have the privilege to be apart of more research driven agendas. These projects mainly identify more disruptive changes to the technology's status quo. Such projects are nabla containers and trusted identity.

## Moving forward. The blog.

I decided to restart my blog, as I had accumulated many interesting thoughts that I would like to share with others. In addition to that, I see myself solving some isolated problems that may not have an obvious google search answer, and that I want to make those solutions public.

I've moved the blog from wordpress to jekyll for convenience of writing articles without having to deal with too much HTML, and easier management of articles.

The topics in the blog will probably be more diverse in nature than previously, and I hope that you will enjoy the new articles!
