title: Running a Nabla Container
---

I wrote a tutorial blog post about running a "Hello World" for Nabla containers! 

[Check it out on here!](https://nabla-containers.github.io/2018/06/28/nabla-setup/)

## Preview

Earlier, we introduced [Nabla Containers](https://nabla-containers.github.io). In this article we will show how you can get started with Nabla-containers! We will go through the build and installation process, and get you started on running your first nabla container - in 3 simple steps! In the following articles, we will show how you can create your own nabla containerized `node.js` and `python` applications!

This article assumes a linux machine with golang and docker. But if you don't have that, we have provided instructions in the appendix to create a ubuntu VM as our development machine (but of course, you don't have to!).
