Adding someone you don't know on Facebook may not only expose your private information , but it may also lead to the compromise of your account. Facebook recently added a new feature in which users may retrieve their account if they lost their password credentials.

## How? 

![FBLogin]({{ '/public/img/posts/2011-11-05-fb-friend-compromise/fblogin.jpg' | relative_url }})

This process is based mainly on the knowledge of your account and a trust-based model of security, where Facebook requires your 'friends' to prove your authenticity. The process is fairly simple. Facebook will let choose 3 trusted friends in which they will send a 'secret' number to them. By entering these codes, the user will be able to complete the process of password recovery.

This is where the main problem lies. If a Facebook user adds at least 3 different and very beautiful young lady friends, which happens to be owned by a malicious user, his account can be compromised through the new password recovery feature.

## Will users really add someone they don't know?
I'd like to think that the answer to this is a 'yes'. However, I have been proven wrong on several accounts. A while ago, I had a few friends who created a Facebook user with the name "Ah Long" (which is a common male name of a loan shark/illegal money lender), with a gender of female (Really... any more obvious?).

They went around adding people on the social network from a single institute. The results were shocking. Within a few days, we got 500-1000 users from the school who accepted our friend requests. I was appauled to know that some of the victims were my personal friends.
In addition, mutual friends also means that once several accounts in a network are compromised, the attacker has it easy.

## Isn't there already an additional layer of security in place?
A few months back, I completed this process for a friend that had his account compromised. Yes, indeed. Facebook has added an additional check which requires users to upload a copy of their identity card. Facebook also mentions that confidential information should be blanked out (i.e. SSNs, NRICs, etc.) - this gives me an impression they don't check for photoshopped IDs.

In my opinion, it would be fairly easy to create a picture identification based on the user's 500+ photos. If physical counterfeit IDs can be made, virtual ones should be a walk in the park.

## How can we protect against this?
- Be wary of people adding you (or vice versa). Always double-check and do housekeeping on friends (esp. those who may have been compromised)
- Enable Facebook 2-factor authentication feature
- Set and regularly review privacy settings (privacy policies change quite frequently and may result in leakage of data)
