Hi guys, a lot of people have been asking me if I have a blog at a lot of the previous security conferences. Therefore, I have decided to make one. What i'll be putting up here will range from technical stuff to topics on a higher level, including some of my personal findings. 

Hope that this blog will provide you with an interesting read. Cheers!
